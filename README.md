Duck Marines
==========

The Libre version of "Duck Marines" created by IntinteDAO aims to adapt the game to FSF / GNU requirements and promote the game in FLOSS environments. I wanted to thank Tangram Games for creating this great production and many others.

Duck Marines (working title) is a cross-platform free software remake of Sonic Team's Chu ChuRocket for the Sega Dreamcast.

ChuChu Rocket is an amazing party game but few people own a Dreamcast these days.
Duck Marines try to recreate the magic of the original game's multiplayer on the PC.

Duck Marines will feature entirely new assets (sprites, music etc.) and gameplay changes that we find appropriate, while still staying true to the original.
